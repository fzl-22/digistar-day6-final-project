## How to run the project

> This project uses TypeScript. So to run the project, it needs to be compiled to JavaScript. The `start` script is already includes the compilation script.

First, install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the project with start script to include the `.env`.

```bash
# this script also runs `npm run build` to compile the project to JavaScript.
npm run start
```

If you want to use `ts-node-dev` instead, run this command.

```bash
npm run dev
```
